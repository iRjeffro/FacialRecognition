This is my AI facial recognition React web app. 
This is the front end portion that goes with my backend (see repository FacialRecognitionAPI).

This web app includes a registration and login screen, which stores the information in a postgreSQL db, with an encrypted hash for the passwords.
The web app uses clarifai API for AI facial recognition of user entered image links.
