This is my AI facial recognition React web app. 
This is the front end portion that goes with my backend (see repository FacialRecognitionAPI).

This web app includes a registration and login screen, which stores the information in a postgreSQL db, with an encrypted hash for the passwords.
The web app uses clarifai API for AI facial recognition of user entered image links.

This used to be hosted in AWS, using EC2 and an RDS db but is now hosted in netlify - https://jeffro-facial-recognition.netlify.app/
